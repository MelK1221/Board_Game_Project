Sisters project tracking board games :)


Board Game Collection Manager

A simple app to log, browse, and rate board games you own or have played.

Stage 1:

* Learn Python basics and file I/O or JSON storage
* Build a simple CLI interface at first
* Add basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)


Stage 2:

* FastAPI backend to serve and query game data
* PostgreSQL to store the game collection
* Simple frontend with HTML/JS
* Use SQLAlchemy as the ORM


Bonus idea: Integrate with the BoardGameGeek API to fetch game info automatically.
